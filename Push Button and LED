The requirements for this program are the same as before but with just one new inclusion in it.

    1) Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega 2560 (They are the beginning boards of Arduino)
    2) Jumper Wires (Male to Male)
    3) Led
    4) Push Button
    5) Breadboard
    6) 10 K (more preferable) or 1k resistor
    7) Cable (To connect board with your Computer for uploading the Program)
    8) Arduino Program
    
    UPDATED 10/9/2019 - LED to Arduino pin 3 and button to Arduino pin 4*/


    //Example code//
 //constants   
const int buttonPin = 8;
const int ledPin = 9;
int buttonState = 0;
int flag=0;

void setup() {
//input or output
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); }  //INPUT_PULLUP with pinMode().monitors the state of a switch by establishing serial communication between your Arduino and your computer.


void loop()
// read button state (pressed or not pressed?)
{ buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); //Arduino is commanded to find out if the input is being recieved from the button (buttonPin) by pushing (as we defined it as Input Pull Up).
//if button is pressed
if (buttonState == LOW)
//ones, turn on led!
{ if ( flag == 0)

{ digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);

flag=1; //change flag variable

} // twice..turn off led!

else if ( flag == 1){

digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);

flag=0; } } //change flag variable again

delay(200); } //small delay
