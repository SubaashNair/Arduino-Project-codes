Arduino Project codes for Arduino Club

**Project 2: LED_push_button**

   **REQUIREMENTS**
   
    1. Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega 2560 (They are the beginning boards of Arduino)
    2. Jumper Wires (Male to Male)
    3. Led
    4. Push Button
    5. Breadboard
    6. 10 K (more preferable) or 1k resistor
    7. Cable (To connect board with your Computer for uploading the Program)
    8. Arduino Program (Downloadable from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
    
   **Lesson Objective**
     
   Input Pull up and else if are the new terms we are going to learn today.
   Input Pull Up: This example demonstrates the use of INPUT_PULLUP with pinMode(). It monitors the state of a switch establishing serial communication between your Arduino and your computer.
   Else if: It is actually almost the same as else.buttonState=digitalRead(buttonPin) is a tool where the Arduino is commanded to find out if the input is being recieved from the button (buttonPin) by pushing (as we defined it as Input Pull Up).
