**Objective**

  This projects aims to demystify the Arduino microcontroller through hands-on work in the lab creating simple machines with  embodied behaviors. The Arduino is a versatile resource for physical projects for students in all disciplines. This projects brings students over the beginnerâ€™s threshold to a basic understanding of the use, terminology, and potential of the Arduino. The skills and concepts taught in this course are presented from an interdisciplinary approach which merges practices in arts and technology. The first portion will teach the essential skills for creating a simple sensor-driven physical computing system, and the second portion will reinforce those skills by making a simple interactive project.
